# Status
Rejected, probably? I submitted 2 proposals to this conference and the other one wasn't accepted. Let's be real though this one wasn't very good and was rejected everywhere else, so it probably wouldn't have made it.

# Title
DIY Network Tracing When All You Have is Python

# Description
In monitoring, we start with a simple question, "What's going on in my system?", and quickly get overwhelmed by an avalanche of open source libraries and SaaS vendors promising to answer all of our questions in neat packages. We want the answers, but we feel paralyzed by the complexity of setting up instrumentation, the uncertainty of investing months of time without guaranteed benefit, and the fear that generic tools might not fit our specific situations.

In this talk, I'll share my first experience writing production-quality Python as a new software engineer to solve a problem we had been stuck on for years. We wanted to know where our backend was spending its time and where we could make it faster. We knew it would take months to get an open source tool like Zipkin to work in our system, so we instead used our understanding of networking and Python to find a solution that met most of our needs with a fraction of the development time. With a little monkey patching and a big DIY attitude, we'll learn to feel empowered to tackle problems with Python on our side.
