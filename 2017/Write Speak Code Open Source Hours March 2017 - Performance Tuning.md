Invited! Julia Nguyen asked me to give a 15 minute talk at the start of this meetup event. Despite this talk idea being rejected _everywhere_, I decided I still wanted to speak it. I'm glad I got to do this talk in a low-pressure environment because I ended up making some [hilarious, informal slides](https://speakerdeck.com/amyngyn/diy-performance-tuning-when-all-you-have-is-python) that I'm still very proud of.

# Title
DIY Performance Tuning When All You Have Is Python

# Description
We wanted to know where our backend was spending its time and where we could make it faster. We knew it would take months to get an open source tool like Zipkin to work in our system, so we instead used our understanding of networking and Python to find a solution that met most of our needs with a fraction of the development time. In this talk, I'll show how we can learn to feel empowered to tackle big problems with a little bit of Python on our side.
