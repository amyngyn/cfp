Accepted, but I didn't accept the invitation! By this point, I had been invited to too many conferences in the same time period and couldn't justify taking more time off. Great problem to have!

# Title
UX Design and Education for Useful Internal Tools

# Abstract
The fastest way to become a 10X engineer is enabling 10 other engineers to do their jobs more effectively. Last year, our internal tools were unintuitive and filled with friction. We took steps to understand where people struggled and redesigned our tools. In this talk, I will explain how we approached UI design, made timeseries concepts more intuitive, and improved our training. By the end, you will understand the value of user experience for internal tools and become the 10X factor of your organization.

# Notes
Here is the general outline of what I plan to cover (but there may be more - I plan to practice with timing/editing):

Motivational and theoretical lessons:
- The biggest impact you can have as an internal tools engineer is by improving the UX of your tools and educating the rest of the engineers in your company. You can be a 10x engineer by making 10 other engineers work faster.
- Design your tools for laypeople - don't assume domain-specific knowledge. Imagine your hypothetical customer as someone who hasn't used any systems like yours yet (more common than you think) and check your assumptions about what people should know when using your tools.

Actionable lessons (Education):
- Know when it's time for education vs intuition: Sometimes it's important that a user understands distinctions about your domain (e.g., for metrics, don't use the average of percentiles), but most of the time it's not important (e.g., is their data coming from Graphite or OpenTSDB?).
- Clear, updated, and discoverable documentation is a part of the user experience of interacting with your team. In our case, we found it best to write a single page of all common questions with a table of contents so that users could cmd+F the topics they were interested in and skim. This was an improvement over our previous system of adding a new wiki page of instructions for every question.
- Make yourself open and accessible - if your team is intimidating or unfriendly to newcomers, people will struggle silently rather than asking you questions.

Actionable lessons (UX):
- Reduce friction by anticipating the most common use cases and pre-fill those as defaults in your tool
- Lessen anxiety by rewarding users for exploration. For example, if a user refreshes a page or clicks the back button, they shouldn't lose their progress; if they are looking at the configuration for something, they shouldn't be afraid of accidentally making an irreversible change.

# Pitch
This is a topic I care deeply about and I want more people to consider. In the past year, I've changed my team's reputation from being "confusing, badly written, slow internal tools" to "helpful, approachable team with well-designed internal tools." I believe there are parallels between product-facing UX design and company-facing UX design and both these disciplines can learn from each other. Internal tools UX design faces a different set of challenges and constraints than traditional UX design. I'm not saying "this is how you become a 10X engineer" as a catchy line or a joke - this is how I truly believe we can improve our organizations.

This will be my first year of speaking at conferences. I'll be giving tailored versions of this talk at TechSummit Berlin, Monitorama, and LISA17. I have three years of experience as a university teaching assistant and am comfortable with pacing for 30-45 minute sessions and speaking in front of large audiences about technical topics.
